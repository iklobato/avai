# Changelog

All notable changes to **avai** (PyPI: `avai-monitor`, Docker:
`iklob1/avai`). Versions follow semantic versioning.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **System resources collectors + dashboard panel (htop-style telemetry).** Two new snapshot collectors capture the aggregate resource meters every cycle: `HostResourcesCollector` → `host_resources` (memory, swap, per-core + overall CPU, load average, uptime, task/thread counts) and `DiskUsageCollector` → `disk_usage` (per-filesystem capacity + best-effort per-device I/O). Both are psutil-backed and cross-platform (registered on macOS, Linux, and Windows), with psutil access behind injectable `SystemMetrics` / `DiskMetrics` runtime seams (mirroring `PsutilConnections`) and uptime derived from the injected `Clock`. They're continuous metrics, not discrete artifacts, so they're not LLM-judged (`judge_enabled = False`). New `/fragments/resources` dashboard panel renders current values as stat tiles, a `df`-style disk table, and Chart.js memory/swap/CPU trend lines (`/api/chart/resources`) — not realtime; it polls on the standard 30 s cadence. Schema migration `0004_host_resources`.

### Fixed
- **SQLite `busy_timeout` eliminates "database is locked" under concurrent writers.** The snapshot loop and the streaming-worker threads serialise their writes through SQLite; with only the 5 s pysqlite default a write or WAL checkpoint on a large DB could hold the lock longer and the losing writer raised (observed on `auth_events` streaming flushes). Every connection now sets a 30 s `busy_timeout` so the contender blocks-and-retries instead of failing.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Cooperative control plane for the dashboard.** Pause/resume the monitor, trigger an immediate scan, toggle individual collectors, change runtime settings (interval, judge, enrich), and run maintenance actions — all from the dashboard. State is exchanged via a new `control_state` table the monitor reads each cycle. Every mutating `/control/*` endpoint is gated by a shared-secret `X-Avai-Token` header (set `AVAI_CONTROL_TOKEN`); it fails closed (control disabled) when the secret is unset, and the custom header doubles as CSRF defence.
- **Baseline security headers on every dashboard response.** Content-Security-Policy (including `frame-ancestors 'none'`), `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`; the WSGI server banner is masked.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard brings the DB schema current on every start.** Running `create_all` + Alembic upgrade at launch means a database written by an older monitor (missing a newly-added table such as `control_state`) no longer 500s every panel — missing tables are added without touching existing data.
- **Findings page no longer returns HTTP 500 on a huge `?page=`.** An out-of-range page built an `OFFSET` past SQLite's 64-bit integer range; the page is now clamped to the last page.
- **Enricher real-API correctness & rate-limit handling.** `circl_hashlookup` uses the real `hashlookup:trust` score (no more false-benign whitelisting of untrusted hashes); `osv` CVE lookups use `GET /v1/vulns/{id}` (the old `POST /v1/query {"id":…}` returns HTTP 400) and surface CVE aliases so the CVE forward-chain fires; `urlhaus` parses the `/host/` response shape separately from `/url/`; `phishtank` (HTTP 509) and `nvd` (HTTP 403) over-quota responses surface as rate-limits; `greynoise` non-404 client errors are raised, not silently swallowed.
- **LLM judge robustness.** `--judge-batch-size 0`/negative can no longer break the monitor cycle (clamped to ≥1); model verdict/category strings are case-normalized before enum coercion, so a `"Malicious"` from JSON-mode is no longer downgraded to `unknown`.
- **Incident narrator caps the findings** fed to the LLM (most severe/confident first) so a host with hundreds of active findings can't blow the context window and silently stop generating the digest.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- **System integrity booleans corrected (SSH, Screen Sharing, ARD, Gatekeeper).** `launchctl list <label>` only searches the user session domain; system-domain services (`sshd`, `screensharingd`, `ARDAgent`) always returned "not found" → always OFF. `pgrep -x <process>` is now used instead, correctly reflecting the running state. The ARD agent was also registered as an `OnDemand` stub in the user session (exit 0) even when Remote Management was disabled, making it always show ON. Fixed. Gatekeeper's `spctl --status` always exits 0 regardless of state — now parses stdout for `assessments enabled` / `assessments disabled` instead of using the exit code.
- **Waitress task queue depth warnings eliminated.** Dashboard's waitress thread count raised from 6 → 16 to absorb the burst of ~10 concurrent HTMX fragment requests that fire on every page load/poll.

### Added
- **TCC privacy permissions section.** New `/fragments/tcc` dashboard card shows every app's camera, microphone, location, screen recording, and full disk access grant/denial — with LLM verdict, allowed/denied/limited status, and scope badge. Filterable by verdict, auth status, and app name.
- **Auth events section — aggregated view.** New `/fragments/auth-events` collapses the raw streaming log (500k+ rows) into unique `(process, subsystem, message)` patterns sorted by frequency. Summary cards show totals per subsystem (TCC, securityd, syspolicy, opendirectoryd, loginwindow). Filterable by subsystem, verdict, and free-text search.
- **LLM judging for auth events.** `AuthEventsCollector` (macOS and Linux) now has `judge_enabled = True` with `judge_fields = ("process", "subsystem", "event_message")` — each unique event pattern is judged once, verdict persists across all occurrences. New `auth_events` prompt hint guides the LLM to flag auth failures, unexpected TCC grants, Gatekeeper denials, and keychain access by rogue processes. Patterns can be sorted by verdict severity in the dashboard.
- **Filter + pagination for all dashboard tables.** Every table now has: free-text search, relevant dropdowns (verdict, scope, subsystem, resolution level, auth status), per-page selector (10/25/50/100), and prev/next pagination. Auth events pagination is fully DB-side (avoids loading 500k rows into memory). Persistence section has independent per-sub-table paginators (SSH keys, /etc/hosts, privilege config).

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **Dashboard runs on a production WSGI server (waitress).** `avai
  dashboard` previously used Flask's development server and printed
  "This is a development server. Do not use it in a production
  deployment." It now serves on waitress (pure-Python, cross-platform);
  `--debug` still uses the Werkzeug reloader/debugger, and a missing
  waitress degrades to the dev server rather than failing. Adds
  `waitress>=3.0` as a dependency.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-29

### Changed
- **CLI defaults so the bare commands "just work".** `avai monitor` now
  defaults to `--db ~/.avai/avai.db --interval 300
  --judge-max-per-collector 25`, and `avai dashboard` to
  `--db ~/.avai/avai.db --port 8765` — the monitor and dashboard share
  one per-user DB with no flags. (`DEFAULT_DB_PATH` moved from the cwd to
  `~/.avai/avai.db`; `--judge-max-per-collector` default 200 → 25.) Use
  `sudo -E` so `~` resolves to your home, not root's.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **network_flows: data volume (payload bytes).** tcpdump already prints
  a per-packet payload length we were discarding — now summed per flow
  (`byte_count`) and shown as the headline traffic metric (e.g. `4.8 MB`),
  with packets/flows demoted to a detail line. Volume distinguishes a
  chatty small-packet beacon from a bulk transfer / exfil in a way a raw
  packet count can't. The summary card leads with total volume; falls
  back to packet count when bytes are unknown (older rows).
- **Process → flow attribution.** Each network flow now names the owning
  process (and pid) when resolvable. A new injectable
  `ProcessConnectionResolver` snapshots the kernel connection table
  (psutil) and correlates each flow's `(dst_ip, dst_port)` to the local
  process behind it — surfaced as a new **process** column in the
  flow table.
- **DNS query collector (`dns_queries`).** A second bounded tcpdump
  capture decodes plaintext port-53 questions (split-based, no regex)
  and aggregates them by `(qname, qtype, resolver)`. Queried domains are
  enriched against the domain threat feeds and LLM-judged. Connections to
  well-known DoH resolver endpoints on :443 are flagged (`qtype=DoH`)
  since they bypass plaintext DNS visibility. New dashboard card.
- **Persistence & tampering collectors.** `ssh_authorized_keys` (every
  key authorizing SSH login, with SHA256 fingerprint + from=/command=
  restrictions), `hosts_file` (`/etc/hosts` mappings — hijack/sinkhole
  detection), and `privilege_config` (sudoers rules, admin/wheel/sudo
  group members, UID-0 accounts). All cross-platform, surfaced in a new
  **persistence & tampering** dashboard section. Parsing is split into
  pure functions (testable) with thin IO.
- New indicator extractors wire `dns_queries` → DOMAIN and `hosts_file`
  → DOMAIN/IP into the enrichment chain. Judge hints added for all four
  collectors.

Collector coverage: macOS 22 → 26, Linux 17 → 21.

## [0.2.11] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **network_flows: geolocation column per destination.** The
  by-destination flow table now shows where each destination IP sits —
  city / region / country plus the network owner (org / ASN). The data
  comes from the `enrichment_evidence` cache the monitor already
  populates, read through the ORM model (`_attach_ip_enrichment`); when
  several sources carry geo, the richest wins. Degrades to "no geo" when
  a destination has no cached evidence or the cache table is absent
  (older DBs).
- **New enricher: `ipwhois_geo` (ipwho.is).** Free, keyless, HTTPS IP
  geolocation so *every* public destination gets a location, not just
  threat-flagged ones. Validated live against IPv4 and IPv6. Purely
  informational — it never raises a threat verdict. AbuseIPDB
  (countryCode/isp) and Feodo (country/as_name) serve as fallbacks.
- **IPv6 destinations are now enriched + geolocated.** Added an `ipv6`
  indicator type; `NetworkFlowExtractor` emits public IPv6 destinations
  (skipping link-local / ULA / multicast), the geo enricher accepts both
  families, and the dashboard joins geo for both. The tcpdump aggregator
  already captured IPv6 (`IP6`) flows; they just weren't being enriched.
- **network_flows: resolved hostname in the destination column.** When
  any source resolved a hostname/domain for a destination IP (Shodan
  `hostnames`, AbuseIPDB `domain`), it's shown under the IP.

### Fixed
- **macOS: flows mislabelled `pktap` instead of the real interface.**
  Without `-i`, macOS tcpdump captures through the `pktap` pseudo-device
  that aggregates every interface, so all flows showed `pktap`. The
  collector now passes `-k I` so tcpdump prints the real per-packet
  interface (en0, en1, awdl0, …), and a `pktap*` listen-banner falls
  back to "unknown" rather than masking it.

## [0.2.10] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Dashboard 500 ("no such column: network_flows.iface") against a
  network_flows table written by an older monitor.** The read-only
  dashboard can't migrate the schema, so `network_flows()` now checks
  the table's columns and substitutes a NULL literal for any missing
  newer column (iface / service) instead of crashing. (`_existing_columns`.)

## [0.2.9] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **network_flows: source interface + by-destination aggregation.**
  Flows now record the capture interface (Linux `tcpdump -i any`
  per-packet; macOS reads it from tcpdump's "listening on <iface>"
  banner). The dashboard table is now aggregated **by destination IP** —
  SUM(packets), COUNT(flows), the set of interfaces / protocols / ports,
  and the worst verdict per destination — with a summary header
  (destinations / flows / packets / malicious / suspicious).

### Fixed
- **Dashboard 500 ("no such table: network_flows") against an older
  DB.** A database written by a monitor that predates a collector lacks
  its table; the row-counts and network-flows panels now skip / empty
  out missing tables instead of crashing (`_existing_tables` guard).

## [0.2.8] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Network-flow aggregator collector (`network_flows`).** A new
  collector runs `tcpdump` for a bounded window each cycle and
  aggregates outbound packets into distinct `(proto, dst_ip, dst_port)`
  flows with a packet count ("top talkers"). Each new public-IP
  destination is enriched against the threat-intel sources (Feodo
  Tracker, AbuseIPDB, GreyNoise, Shodan, …) and then judged by the LLM,
  so malicious requests — C2 beacons, exfiltration, connections to
  known-bad IPs — surface as findings. Parsing is split-based (no
  regex). Requires root to capture (the monitor already runs as root).
  Collector counts are now 22 (macOS) / 17 (Linux).
- **Dashboard "network flows" table** at the bottom of the page — one
  full-width table listing each flow with its verdict, destination,
  port/service, packet count, and the LLM's reasoning.

## [0.2.7] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **"Dismiss all" button on the dashboard toast stack.** When the
  monitor is actively judging, malicious/suspicious alerts pile up;
  previously each had to be closed individually. A "Dismiss all (N)"
  bar now appears above the stack — one click clears every toast and
  advances the alert cursor so they don't immediately re-appear on the
  next poll.

## [0.2.6] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Dashboard showed "no run yet" for the entire first cycle.**
  `latest_run()` only returned *completed* runs, so while the monitor
  ground through its first cycle (minutes of collecting + LLM judging)
  every panel sat empty — and if the monitor was killed/restarted
  mid-cycle, it stayed empty forever. Now it prefers the latest
  completed run but **falls back to the most recent in-progress run**,
  so the dashboard shows live, partial data immediately. Steady state
  is unchanged (a completed run is still preferred → no flicker).

## [0.2.5] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **LLM judge calls had no timeout — a stalled API request froze the
  whole cycle.** With the judge enabled the first cycle makes hundreds
  of LLM calls (one batch per 20 entries per collector); if any single
  request hung, the run never reached `end_run`, so it never showed as
  *completed* and the dashboard (which only lists completed runs)
  stayed empty forever. Added a 60 s per-call timeout to both the
  litellm and Anthropic-OAuth paths (`DEFAULT_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_S`); on
  timeout the batch is skipped and the cycle proceeds, so runs always
  complete and the dashboard populates.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Ctrl-C didn't stop `avai monitor` during a cycle.** The SIGINT
  handler only set a shutdown flag (replacing Python's default
  KeyboardInterrupt), and the flag was checked only between cycles —
  so while the LLM judge ground through every collector (minutes on
  the first run), Ctrl-C was swallowed and the terminal appeared
  hung. Now: the collector loop checks the flag and stops after the
  current step on the first Ctrl-C, and a **second Ctrl-C force-quits
  immediately** (guaranteed escape hatch).

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- **Dashboard 500'd ("no such table") on first run against a live
  database.** The read engine used `?mode=ro&immutable=1`; `immutable=1`
  tells SQLite to ignore the `-wal` file, so when the monitor and
  dashboard start together the schema is still in the WAL (not yet
  checkpointed) and every query fails. Dropped `immutable=1` — `mode=ro`
  reads the WAL correctly. Verified it doesn't regress the Docker
  bind-mount case it was originally added for.
- **System-integrity panel mislabeled Linux data as macOS.** A row
  collected by the Linux collector (e.g. the monitor in Docker's Linux
  VM) rendered under macOS labels (FileVault, Gatekeeper…) with unset
  columns showing a false "OFF". The panel is now platform-aware and
  shows a macOS/Linux badge.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- **`launch_items` collector crashed in container mode.**
  `host_paths_for_home()` returned an empty list when `HOST_PREFIX`
  was set but neither `<prefix>/home/*` nor `<prefix>/root` were
  mounted; the caller indexed `[0]` → `IndexError` killed the whole
  collector every cycle. Now iterates the returned paths (also fixes a
  latent bug where only the first user home was ever scanned).
- **CamelCase config keys were silently dropped (3 collectors).**
  Python's `configparser` lowercases keys by default, so every
  `.get("ExecStart")` / `.get("Name")` / `.get("Alias")` missed:
  - systemd units lost `program` / `keep_alive` / `user_name` /
    `run_at_load` / schedule — the LLM judge was effectively blind on
    the persistence surface.
  - `.desktop` apps lost name / version / exec.
  - BlueZ devices lost name / class.
  Fixed with `optionxform = str` on all three parsers.

### Testing
- Added `tests/test_collectors.py` and expanded the suite to 320+
  network-free unit tests across the enrichment framework, all 17
  sources, indicator extractors, HTTP client, CLI, repository + DB
  rotation, LLM-judge parsing, dashboard endpoints, and Linux
  collector file parsing. Mutation-verified: tests fail when the
  implementation breaks.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- `_is_domain()` matched IPv4 literals as domains, routing IP‑host
  URLs to the wrong enrichers.
- Dashboard `_ensure_db_exists()` didn't register the enrichment
  model, so dashboard‑only containers 500'd on the
  `enrichment_evidence` table.
- `Enricher.env_token()` treated an empty‑string env var (`-e VAR=`)
  as a present token, registering keyed enrichers with no key.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Threat‑intel enrichment layer** (`avai.enrichers`). Before each
  finding reaches the LLM, avai extracts indicators (SHA256, IPv4,
  domain, URL, CVE, package, OS version) and cross‑checks them against
  up to **17 external sources**, attaching the evidence to the judge's
  prompt. Results cached in SQLite with per‑source TTLs.
  - Keyless: CIRCL hashlookup, Shodan InternetDB, Feodo Tracker,
    OSV.dev, CISA KEV, NVD, endoflife.date, crt.sh.
  - One free abuse.ch key (`ABUSE_CH_AUTH_KEY`): MalwareBazaar,
    URLhaus, ThreatFox.
  - Per‑service keys: VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, GreyNoise, Google Safe
    Browsing, PhishTank, GitHub Advisory.
- `avai monitor` flags `--no-enrich` and `--enrich-only NAME`.
- `.env.example` documenting every credential; missing keys disable a
  source cleanly.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- Initial release: host‑security telemetry collector (21 collectors on
  macOS, 16 on Linux), LLM threat judge (litellm + Anthropic, OAuth or
  API key), and a read‑only Flask + HTMX + Chart.js dashboard.
- Single Docker image (`iklob1/avai`) with two roles — dashboard
  (default) and monitor — plus `pip install avai-monitor`.
- SQLite storage with size‑based rotation; streaming collectors for
  auth and process‑exec events.
